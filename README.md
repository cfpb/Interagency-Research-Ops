## what this guide is

Documentation lies at the core of a good research operations setup. This Interagency Research Operations site will not meet each agencies needs, rather be an example of how to start thinking through how to draft your internal research processes and operations to allow your research teams to scale, protect PII, understand what tools have been helpful across federal agencies, etc.
